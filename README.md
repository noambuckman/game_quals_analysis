# game_quals_analysis
Code for analyzing and visualizing results


Step 0:  Clone the repo and move the project directory (`cd ~/game_quals_analysis`)

Step 1:  Create a directory `survey_results` in the project directory

Step 2:  Move the XLSX into the new `survey_results/` directory

Step 3:  `python main.py`



Note: Questions were changed in May2022 so a new `survey_questionsMay2022.py` was created.  For now a new `mainMay2022.py` needs to be run for May2022 questions.  

TODO: Create a single `main.py`, that takes in a JSON/txt file that describes all the survey question names.
